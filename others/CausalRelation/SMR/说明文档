This software tool implements the SMR & HEIDI methods to test for pleiotropic association between the expression level of a gene and a complex trait of interest using summary-level data from GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies (Zhu et al. 2016 Nat Genet). The methodology can be interpreted as an analysis to test if the effect size of a SNP on the phenotype is mediated by gene expression. This tool can therefore be used to prioritize genes underlying GWAS hits for follow-up functional studies.

Columns are SNP, the effect (coded) allele, the other allele, frequency of the effect allele, effect size, standard error, p-value and sample size. The headers are not keywords and will be omitted by the program. Important: “A1” needs to be the effect allele with “A2” being the other allele and “freq” needs to be the frequency of “A1”. NOTE:1) For a case-control study, the effect size should be log(odds ratio) with its corresponding standard error.
